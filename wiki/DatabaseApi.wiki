= Introduction =

The database API ([http://gwt-mobile-webkit.googlecode.com/files/gwt-mobile-webkit-database-1.0.0.tar.gz download]) leverages the [http://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/#sql Web Storage Database API].

Using this API you are able to store data in a SQLite database which is embedded in the browser. This is great for offline features of your application.

= Browser support =
Not every browser supports this feature, and currently there are no fallback scenario's to rely on Flash, Java or Gears plugins. We built support for the following browsers:

  # iPhone Safari (OS2.0 and higher - maybe earlier versions are supported, but are untested)
  # Desktop Safari (3.1 and higher)
  # Opera (9.5 and higher)
  # Opera Mobile (9.5 and higher - untested!)
  # Google Android (1.0 and higher - untested!)

NOTE: The Database API as specified by W3C describes two API's: an Asynchronous and a Synchronous API. Currently we only built support for the Asynchronous API, because the Synchronous API isn't supported by the current browsers that much.

= Usage =
== is API supported? ==
The following will test whether the API is supported in your browser:
{{{
if (Database.isSupported()) {
    // Interact with your database...
}
}}}

== Opening a Database ==
This line opens a database and returns a handle to that database:
{{{
Database db = Database.openDatabase("ClckCnt", "1.0", "Click Counter", 10000);
}}}

== Creating a Table ==
This code creates a new table if doesn't exist already:
{{{
db.transaction(new TransactionCallback() {
    public void onTransactionStart(SQLTransaction tx) {
        tx.executeSql("CREATE TABLE clickcount IF NOT EXISTS ("
                + "id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,"
                + "clicked INTEGER)", null);
        }
        public void onTransactionFailure(SQLError error) {
            // handle error...
        }
        public void onTransactionSuccess() {
            // Proceed when successfully committed...
        }
    });
}}}
